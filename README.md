# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-Librosa
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is crucial in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. We implemented an SER model using Librosa for feature extraction and trained a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. Our model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, and recall, demonstrating promising results across various emotions.
