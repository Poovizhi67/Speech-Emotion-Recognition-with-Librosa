# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-with-Librosa
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a critical task in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. In this study, we implemented an SER model using the Librosa library, which is widely used for audio and music signal processing. Our goal was to accurately classify emotions from speech signals, focusing on a set of defined emotional categories. The process involved several key steps: feature extraction using Librosa to capture relevant acoustic features from the audio signals, and training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier on these feature. To evaluate the performance of our SER model, we measured accuracy, precision, and recall for each emotion category. The results of our experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the SER model based on Librosa features, achieving a promising accuracy rate and satisfactory precision and recall scores across different emotions
